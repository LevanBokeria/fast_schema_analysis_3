ptp,Clear instructions?,Notice schema_6_0,Notice schema_2_2,Notice schema_4_2,Notice schema_4_4,Strategy?,Did visible ones help or hinder?,Anything else
sub_001,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,helped. didn't depend on the board.,no
sub_002,yes,no,no,no,no,"I ignored all the visible images and tried to remember the rough location of the hidden ones eg R/L/top/bottom. Once I had memorised that I tried to remember a more specific location eg bottom right, top left.",I ignored them.,"It was fun, thank you!"
sub_003,they were clear,yes,"i noticed that some moved, not specifically 2","i noticed that some moved, not specifically 2",yes,"just learning the general location, distance from corners and edges","i did not use the visible pictures to learn the locations of the hidden ones, at least, not intentionally",n/a
sub_004,Yes they were all clar,yes i noticed this,I recognised this towards the end,yes,Yes i thought this was the case,"I used the square grid to help me work out the distances of the hidden pictures from the edge of the square to help locate it. The same applied with working out the distance of the hidden pictures from the static visible pictures. This strategy worked across the board in the most part, but having to adapt to random movement","Yes, as stated above the visible pictures provided markers for me to work out how many 'squares' I was from a hidden image",None that i can think of; thank you
sub_005,"Yes, instruction were clear",yes,No,no,No,I try to remeber the location of each picture ,It helped alot while i was learning the locations of hidden pictures ,no
sub_006,They seemed pretty clear to me,Maybe?,Yes,I only noticed a couple that didn't move,I  noticed 3 that didn't move,Try to find the best 'reference' visible pictures i.e ones that did not move and were somewhere I deemed noteworthy relative to the hidden pictures.,"The more visible pictures that didn't move, the better, although that isn't really saying much with how badly I did!","None that wouldn't compromise the results of the test in some capacity, I'm sure."
sub_007,"yes, once i started it was easy to follow",no i didn't!,yes,yeah,yes!,i tried to work out which image stayed the same location on each round and used that as a focus point,"it depended on the board, the 4 images were a lot harder than 6!",no
sub_008,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes I made picture clues to help me identify the places,they kind of help in most cases,no
sub_009,Yes!,Yes,Yes,No,No,"I tried to remember the ones adjacent to the visible, stationary pictures. I also had a strategy for remembering that some images were above and some below e.g. pants were below and they're also lower on your body, whereas the cloud was higher up ","The stationary pictures helped, as I would remember which hidden pictures were nearby. It was more confusing with more pictures.",I would suggest having a bigger board on the screen!
sub_010,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I generally focussed on 2 that didn't move, I didn't notice if any others stayed","Again, I focussed on 2 that didn't move so I didn't notice if there were more than that","I looked at the pictures that didn't move and if any hidden pictures were next to them I remembered that. Then I just remembered the location of the hidden pictures roughly according to the square (top left, middle, bottom right etc)","The stable pictures helped me, but the ones that moved randomly did not help, I just dismissed them.",None
sub_011,i wasnt sure how i could name the photos that were visible when iwasnt shown them,no,yeah,no,no,"just said in my head what those objects were near or their basic location, e.g stairs were in the top left corner, or onion was below the table etc",they helped when there was 5-6 but when there were more it made it more difficult,no - thank you.
sub_012,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,I split the grid into 9 sections in my head and assigned the hidden pictures to each grid,Didn't help or hinder,na
sub_013,yes,yes,no,no,no,try to remember some bu was annoying that you said incorrect so easily,o,dont tell people incorrect
sub_014,yes,did not notice ,did not notice,did not notice,did not notice,spatial orientation strategy,just orientation of location,nil
sub_015,clear,I did not!,I did not!,I did not!,I did not!,remember the images near the corners and edges first,hinder,no
sub_016,I thought the instructions were clear.,Yes I did notice this.,I did not notice this.,I did not notice this.,I did not notice this.,"I tried to associate pictures with each other if I spotted that they were near each other often. For example, I noticed that the squirrel was always above the present. I used this strategy for all boards.",Visible pictures helped as some pictures were always nearby a visible picture.,No other feedback.
sub_017,Yes they were clear,"Yes i did notice this, but it was hard to remember the positions of pictures still",No i did not notice this ,i feel like i noticed two of the images stay the same and tried to focus on these ,i feel like i noticed two of the images stay the same and tried to focus on these ,Once i figured out pictures that stayed the same i tried to work out the distance from this to that e.g. on blue board tried to remember the bee was down and along from the spade,"They only helped if they stayed the same, to remember the distance from a hidden and that object, moving objects were useless for this ",non3
sub_018,yes,no,yes,no,yes,not really,"help if they stayed in the same place, hinder if they moved around",no
sub_019,Yes very clue,"Indeed, once I noticed it made the exercise much easier","Yes, I found this helpful",No,"Yes, it helped me orientate my cursor.","Yes, I remember where hidden pictures were in relation to static visible ones",Almost always help.,"No. I felt I could reliably get close, if not exact, so could be worth tracking"
sub_020,Yes the instructions were clear,"Yes, I believe they stayed in the same place each time.","I noticed that some were moving, although wans't sure of how many moved.","Again I realised that some moved, but did not noticed how many did","Noticed that some moved, but did not know how many","I tried to learn where the pictures were in relation to the board as a whole, because I felt that the visible pictures would not be reliable enough to depend on.  For most I tried to remember the pictures with relation to the whole square, although for some I did base it on the static images once I was confident in them.","Sometimes the visible pictures helped, but overall I tried to ignore most of them and focus on where the hidden pictures were in the sqaure as a whole.","No specific feedback, thank you for the chance to participate."
sub_021,yes,yes,no,no,no,"I tried to focus on the middle of the coloured square, apart from the blue board as I noticed that the locations were fixed, so I tried to remember them.",I expected the visible pictures on the blue board to help but I think it actually hindered and I think focussing on the centre of each coloured square was more useful.,n/a
sub_022,yes,no,no,no,no,I tried to match the hidden pictures to a visible item and place it somewhere near it in my head,they usually helped as i could try to associate the images in my mind though they moved at times so it wasnt always easy,no
sub_023,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,I learned where the stable images where and the location of the hidden images to them. I also learned the approximate location from the edge or centre of the hidden images,"Helped, allowed me to use them as markers",None
