ptp,Clear instructions?,Notice schema_6_0,Notice schema_2_2,Notice schema_4_2,Notice schema_4_4,Strategy?,Did visible ones help or hinder?,Anything else
sub_001,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,helped. didn't depend on the board.,no
sub_002,yes,no,no,no,no,"I ignored all the visible images and tried to remember the rough location of the hidden ones eg R/L/top/bottom. Once I had memorised that I tried to remember a more specific location eg bottom right, top left.",I ignored them.,"It was fun, thank you!"
sub_003,they were clear,yes,"i noticed that some moved, not specifically 2","i noticed that some moved, not specifically 2",yes,"just learning the general location, distance from corners and edges","i did not use the visible pictures to learn the locations of the hidden ones, at least, not intentionally",n/a
sub_004,Yes they were all clar,yes i noticed this,I recognised this towards the end,yes,Yes i thought this was the case,"I used the square grid to help me work out the distances of the hidden pictures from the edge of the square to help locate it. The same applied with working out the distance of the hidden pictures from the static visible pictures. This strategy worked across the board in the most part, but having to adapt to random movement","Yes, as stated above the visible pictures provided markers for me to work out how many 'squares' I was from a hidden image",None that i can think of; thank you
sub_005,"Yes, instruction were clear",yes,No,no,No,I try to remeber the location of each picture ,It helped alot while i was learning the locations of hidden pictures ,no
sub_006,They seemed pretty clear to me,Maybe?,Yes,I only noticed a couple that didn't move,I  noticed 3 that didn't move,Try to find the best 'reference' visible pictures i.e ones that did not move and were somewhere I deemed noteworthy relative to the hidden pictures.,"The more visible pictures that didn't move, the better, although that isn't really saying much with how badly I did!","None that wouldn't compromise the results of the test in some capacity, I'm sure."
sub_007,"yes, once i started it was easy to follow",no i didn't!,yes,yeah,yes!,i tried to work out which image stayed the same location on each round and used that as a focus point,"it depended on the board, the 4 images were a lot harder than 6!",no
sub_008,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes I made picture clues to help me identify the places,they kind of help in most cases,no
sub_009,Yes!,Yes,Yes,No,No,"I tried to remember the ones adjacent to the visible, stationary pictures. I also had a strategy for remembering that some images were above and some below e.g. pants were below and they're also lower on your body, whereas the cloud was higher up ","The stationary pictures helped, as I would remember which hidden pictures were nearby. It was more confusing with more pictures.",I would suggest having a bigger board on the screen!
sub_010,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I generally focussed on 2 that didn't move, I didn't notice if any others stayed","Again, I focussed on 2 that didn't move so I didn't notice if there were more than that","I looked at the pictures that didn't move and if any hidden pictures were next to them I remembered that. Then I just remembered the location of the hidden pictures roughly according to the square (top left, middle, bottom right etc)","The stable pictures helped me, but the ones that moved randomly did not help, I just dismissed them.",None
sub_011,i wasnt sure how i could name the photos that were visible when iwasnt shown them,no,yeah,no,no,"just said in my head what those objects were near or their basic location, e.g stairs were in the top left corner, or onion was below the table etc",they helped when there was 5-6 but when there were more it made it more difficult,no - thank you.
sub_012,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,I split the grid into 9 sections in my head and assigned the hidden pictures to each grid,Didn't help or hinder,na
sub_013,yes,yes,no,no,no,try to remember some bu was annoying that you said incorrect so easily,o,dont tell people incorrect
sub_014,yes,did not notice ,did not notice,did not notice,did not notice,spatial orientation strategy,just orientation of location,nil
sub_015,clear,I did not!,I did not!,I did not!,I did not!,remember the images near the corners and edges first,hinder,no
sub_016,I thought the instructions were clear.,Yes I did notice this.,I did not notice this.,I did not notice this.,I did not notice this.,"I tried to associate pictures with each other if I spotted that they were near each other often. For example, I noticed that the squirrel was always above the present. I used this strategy for all boards.",Visible pictures helped as some pictures were always nearby a visible picture.,No other feedback.
sub_017,Yes they were clear,"Yes i did notice this, but it was hard to remember the positions of pictures still",No i did not notice this ,i feel like i noticed two of the images stay the same and tried to focus on these ,i feel like i noticed two of the images stay the same and tried to focus on these ,Once i figured out pictures that stayed the same i tried to work out the distance from this to that e.g. on blue board tried to remember the bee was down and along from the spade,"They only helped if they stayed the same, to remember the distance from a hidden and that object, moving objects were useless for this ",non3
sub_018,yes,no,yes,no,yes,not really,"help if they stayed in the same place, hinder if they moved around",no
sub_019,Yes very clue,"Indeed, once I noticed it made the exercise much easier","Yes, I found this helpful",No,"Yes, it helped me orientate my cursor.","Yes, I remember where hidden pictures were in relation to static visible ones",Almost always help.,"No. I felt I could reliably get close, if not exact, so could be worth tracking"
sub_020,Yes the instructions were clear,"Yes, I believe they stayed in the same place each time.","I noticed that some were moving, although wans't sure of how many moved.","Again I realised that some moved, but did not noticed how many did","Noticed that some moved, but did not know how many","I tried to learn where the pictures were in relation to the board as a whole, because I felt that the visible pictures would not be reliable enough to depend on.  For most I tried to remember the pictures with relation to the whole square, although for some I did base it on the static images once I was confident in them.","Sometimes the visible pictures helped, but overall I tried to ignore most of them and focus on where the hidden pictures were in the sqaure as a whole.","No specific feedback, thank you for the chance to participate."
sub_021,yes,yes,no,no,no,"I tried to focus on the middle of the coloured square, apart from the blue board as I noticed that the locations were fixed, so I tried to remember them.",I expected the visible pictures on the blue board to help but I think it actually hindered and I think focussing on the centre of each coloured square was more useful.,n/a
sub_022,yes,no,no,no,no,I tried to match the hidden pictures to a visible item and place it somewhere near it in my head,they usually helped as i could try to associate the images in my mind though they moved at times so it wasnt always easy,no
sub_023,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,I learned where the stable images where and the location of the hidden images to them. I also learned the approximate location from the edge or centre of the hidden images,"Helped, allowed me to use them as markers",None
sub_024,Yes,"Yes
",No,No,No,No,I didn't pay much attention to the visible pictures,No
sub_025,"It was, very well explained and clear from beginning to end",No,No,Yes,Yes,No particular strategy other than brain memory where they were the last time they came up.,"Hinder, they definitely confused me by moving around to locations where I thought the hidden picture(s) would be.",N/A
sub_026,they were clear,no,no,no,yes,no strategy just trial and error,"slightly helped, perhaps subconsciously ",no
sub_027,"I would say not entirely, as I didn't fully understand the objective until I'd done a round or two, even after the practice stages. I'm not sure how to make it clearer, though.",no,no,no,no,"I tried to picture the square with a grid to then try to remember their ""coordinates""; I used the same overall strategy for each board, but sometimes I envisioned halves, thirds, or quadrants.","I don't think they really aided me in any way, especially because I hadn't noticed some of them kept their location. I focused more on the above strategy.","The pictures are tiny, even in full screen, which makes it quite hard to discern, and also requires one to be quite precise when clicking on where one things the object is. Is this intentional toward the aim of the experiment, or is it just practical logistical requirement for the nature of the study (not enough space, basically)? I feel like if it is a case of the latter, the size/exactness required might skew results."
sub_028,yes,yes,no,no,no,My strategy was to try and see where they were on the bored roughly and remember that. ,They helped only on the blue bored. ,Sometimes it looked like i clicked the picture but it came up as missed
sub_029,yes,I can't remember which ones moved or stayed the same,I can't remember which ones moved or stayed the same,I can't remmeber which ones moved or stayed the same,I can't remember which ones moved or stayed the same,I noticed the ones that appeared beside other images and which side the images tended to appear on ,the visable pictures did help but the fact that the mouse disappeared whilst the images were showing made it more difficult for me ,n/a
sub_030,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no. I just tried my best to memorise where the hidden pictures were allocated,they helped ,no
sub_031,yes,yes,"pretty sure, yes",yes,not sure but think so,"in the blue board I mostly tried to focus on the visible pictures and take them as a focal point to determine the hidden one. with all the other boards, I entirely focused on the positioning of the boards themselves and the rough distances between the borders of the boards and locations of the hidden objects rather than the visible objects which were distracting with their constant movement.","helped on the blue board with them not moving at all, hindered my process in all other cases and made me rely on the boards themselves and their positioning more.",no
sub_032,Clear enough.,Didn't notice at the time.,Did not notice this.,Did not notice.,Did not notice,"intially I tried to memorise simply by saying the name of the object and it's location out loud (e.g. cloud, centre left), then I tried to think of where they were in the real world (e.g. on the third board I would say ""ceiling fan on the roof"" as it was where you would expect it, however this has limited advantages especially when the bulb was ""on the floor""!. By the last board I made an invisible link between each one as they came, I remembered the first was just below centre and then the wheel was to it's right, then the wasp was about up left of this, stair was up left of this, cloud was down from it, and jeans was down-right from this and therefore close to the first object, and so the cycle continued. I imagine I scored best on this last puzzle as this strategy seemed to work for me and I was always close.","Didn't matter as I didn't really use them, I just imagined where the hidden pictures were in isolation. Which is why my answers to the above are that I didn't notice the patterns in the visible pictures.",Allow an extra second to make mind up.
sub_033,yes,yes,no,no,no,"i linked some images to locations e.g. on purple board, stairs lead to the top, it was top left",on the blue board but not the others,no
sub_034,At first I wasn't sure how I was supposed to find the images,Yes,Nope,Nope,Yes,Try to remember how far they were from the edges,Usually only helped when I could use them as a reference to see which hidden ones they were next to,Nope
sub_035,The moving images might have been explained better,No,No,No,No,Just try to remember what they were near,"Helped, but i found the task difficult regardless",None
sub_036,yes they were clear ,yes,no,yes,yes,no strategy just tried best to remember ,helped a little bit on all boards,no
sub_037,yes,cant remember,cant remember,cant remember,cant remember,no strategy,helped on all boards,n/a
sub_038,Yes was clear but the task was incredibly difficult ,Yes,Yes,I only noticed that some moved and some stayed ,I only noticed that lots seemed to be changing.,"I tried to memorise pictures that were near each other as a group, together, but it was not very successful because I could only learn a few of the pictures this way","They definitely helped me,  as I tried to learn locations based on other pictures, but this did also hinder my performance when they moved around.","It was really difficult so to improve performance, making the pictures bigger would be better because I often knew the general area where the hidden picture was but failed to click on the exact spot. Please also see your prolific messages about why my completion time seemed to short! It filled in with the wrong code from another study. Thanks"
sub_039,Yes,"No, I ignored the visible pictures as they weren't important","No, I ignored the visible pictures as they weren't important","No, I ignored the visible pictures as they weren't important","No, I ignored the visible pictures as they weren't important",I tried to remember their positions in relation to the nearest corner,"I didn't pay any attention to the visible pictures, only that they were a uniform size and they fitted into a grid layout. I tried to imagine the grid the pictures were on and worked out their position from the nearest corner, eg 3 up, 3 across, for the Jeans in the fourth trial",Maybe make it clearer that you would have to learn the position of the pictures at the beginning of each block. In the instructions it wasn't clear that you would get the first few wrong whilst you learnt each position
sub_040,they were clear,yes,yes,no,no,trying to remember previous location ,"sometimes helped, other times they were distracting",maybe increase it to 4 secs from 3
sub_041,yes very,yep,yes,yes,no,I tried to anchor them to one of the pictures that remained still - or the edges of the board,it depended,no
sub_042,I felt that the instruction were clear.,"Yes, and I think I did better there than on the others.","Yes, which did help somewhat.","Yes, I did notice that too.","Yes, I did.","Generally, if they were next to a picture that stayed, click there, other than that, work out the distance between the picture and the nearest edge.","It depended on the board. Some of them it did, other times it tricked me.",Nope!
sub_043,Yes,No,No,No,No,To figure out the overall area of where they fell and then I could ignore the outer areas from that in hope to try keep things in a tight circle of locations,"I don't think they did either, I used my memory to try pinpont the locations ",No
sub_044,"No, everything was clear.",Yes,Yes,I'm not sure.,I'm not sure.,"I tried to identify which hidden images were always next to certain images. That made it a lot easier to look out for the visible images and try and remember where they were. For the other images, I tried to remember where they were in relation to edges of the square. This was a lot easier when there were other visible images in the same place every time, as I could use these as points of reference.","Once I knew which ones were relevant this was useful (e.g. which ones had hidden images next to them). Also, on boards where the images stayed in fixed positions, the visible images provided useful points of reference. I ignored them when they kept changing direction though.","No thank you.

This looks like really interesting research though. I hope that it goes well."
sub_045,all clear,yes,yes,yes,no,no ,hinder me,all good
sub_046,they were clear enough,i did,i did,i did,i did not,compare with the border and the visable images,"help, but some helped more than others",none
sub_047,"Yes, they were very clear ",I didn't notice ,I didn't notice ,I didn't notice ,I didn't notice ,"I tried to think of them as how high or low they would be in real life. For example on the last one, I thought of jeans being on the floor, so being lower down. The stairs would be going high past the clouds , etc. ",I didn't focus on the visible pictures. ,No
sub_048,yes they were clear and the practice round was useful,im not sure but I think a couple of them were fixed for sure,im not sure but I think a couple of them were fixed for sure,im not sure but I think a couple of them were fixed for sure,im not sure but I think a couple of them were fixed for sure,yes i would think about distance from the gangles and borders,at first they helped but then they were distracting me,no
sub_049,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,I tried to imagine the board sectioned off into squares and roughly remember which area they were in,"I don't think it helped or hindered, I didn't really look at them.",No
sub_050,yes,yes,no,no,no,"nope, just visual memory",no,no
sub_051,instructions clear,did not notice ,no ,no ,no ,tried to remember which one it paired with ,hinder,no 
sub_052,"yes are clear, by reading the instructions that were given to you ",yes i did,yes,no i didnt ,yes,no i didnt ,yes helped me ,no thank you 
sub_053,"Yeah, they were very clear and not unnecessarily wordy and needlessly complicated like instructions on some studies",I didn't,I didn't ,I didn't ,I didn't,"For most of the study I was paying more attention to the overall position as I found that a little easier than focusing on the visual objects, though I still missed a lot. For the last one I tried paying a bit more attention to the visible objects and actually it did help a little","I thought they were hindering me to begin with, although they did seem to help a little near the end, but either way it was hard to click in the exact position, especially as there wasn't even grids or anything",I think the images could be bigger so people didn't have to zoom in so much but otherwise was great 
sub_054,Yes they were,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Not really, if a hidden picture was next to a visible picture I would try to remember where",Definitely helped on boards where some visible pictures stayed the same,No thank you
sub_055,"yeah pretty much, the only thing I'd say, is I weirdly thought I'd see the pictures that where in hidden in the general areas before we started and thought I was missing something. ",yes,no,no,no,"corners in general areas, I tried to get them in the right place",bit of both ,Give us a little bit of le-way. I clicked a pixel off and failed some haha
